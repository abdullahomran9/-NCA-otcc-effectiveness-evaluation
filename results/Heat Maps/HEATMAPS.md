# ICS Cybersecurity Standards Heatmaps

This folder contains heatmap visualizations of industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity standards mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.

## Contents

- `Nist_800_82_Mappings`: Heatmap for NIST SP 800-82 in png and svg format 
- `IEC_62443_Mappings`: Heatmap for IEC 62443 in png and svg format 
- `Nca_Otcc_Mappings`: Heatmap for NCA OTCC (Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority Operational Technology Cybersecurity  Controls) in png and svg format

## Overview

These heatmaps provide a visual representation of how each cybersecurity standard covers the various tactics and techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. The color intensity indicates the level of coverage or emphasis each standard places on specific ATT&CK techniques.

## Interpretation

- Darker colors indicate stronger coverage or emphasis
- Lighter colors indicate less coverage or emphasis
- White cells indicate no direct mapping to the standard

## Usage

These heatmaps can be used to:

1. Quickly assess the coverage of each standard across the ATT&CK framework
2. Identify potential gaps in coverage for specific tactics or techniques
3. Compare the focus areas of different standards
4. Guide further in-depth analysis of specific areas of interest

For a more detailed and interactive exploration of these mappings, refer to the accompanying MITRE Navigator layer files and STIX mapping files in the parent directory.
